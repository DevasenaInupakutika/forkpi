[.] Change sign-up process
	Admins can approve new users, edit db and view logs
	Regular users can edit db and view logs
BUG: Scan RFID close window while polling -> next poll causes crash
Only forkpi has write keypair permission
BUG: Can save keypair while waiting for rfid tag
show error message if forkpi is not running
restore all defaults for options

[.] main.py and Swipe RFID polling at the same time causes crash - issue avoided since ForkPi and SpoonPi are never together on one machine
[x] delete old logs
[x] name editing must reflect with the RFID_UID and PIN
[x] lock out after entering wrong pin 5 times in a row
[x] save log
[x] Edit RFID UID
[x] Encode DB, passing of keypairs from views to templates
[x] flash messages lol
[x] salted passwords
[x] check valid pin and rfid uid
[x] check valid pin for editing
[x] PIN remove from pdf
[x] Deactivate/disable keypairs
[x] Filter logs by date, allowed/denied, uid, pin
[x] Access ForkPi over the local network using its host name
[x] Change lock-out time / attempt limit
[.] Change key used to encrypt keypairs to AES key transferred using RSA - issue avoided since acceptable security already achieved?
[x] BUG: Lockout timers are only updated after a transaction -> denied the first time you swipe after the timer expires
[.] Option for 6 digit PIN - onchange disable all existing keypairs with 4-digit PIN
	Or: Make PINs not necessarily uniform length; can be 4-10 digits
		Might require the use of an 'Enter' button for security reasons
[x] '#' enter, '*' backspace
[x] read secret key from file
[x] regenerate secret key
[.] Mass-delete disabled keypairs - no mass disabling of keypairs so no need

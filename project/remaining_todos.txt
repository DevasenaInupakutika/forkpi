[.] Change sign-up process
	Admins can approve new users, edit db and view logs
	Regular users can edit db and view logs


Schema changes:
	Keypair:
		add field bytea fingerprint_template
		separate hashes for pin and rfid_uid
	Add table keypair_doors with fields
		keypair_id
		door_id
	Add table doors with fields
		id
		name
		serial
	Logs:
		add field Boolean fingerprint_used

fingerprint matching process:
	forkpi stores template in keypair upon enrollment
	spoonpi: SELECT name, fingerprint_template FROM records_keypair WHERE door_serial=myserial
	spoonpi: upload templates to scanner db in batches of 200
		if match is found
			allow name

# Why we cannot match fingers in forkpi:
	Multiple SpoonPis might cause simultaneous uploading to the forkpi scanner
	Someone might use SpoonPi to verify while someone is enrolling in ForkPi

BUG: Scan RFID close window while polling -> next poll causes crash
Only forkpi has write keypair permission
BUG: Can save keypair while waiting for rfid tag
show error message if forkpi is not running
restore all defaults for options
Usability Test
Fingerprint scanner and rfid polling at the same time
Test if Pis can communicate over local network wirelessly using a router with no internet connection

[.] main.py and Swipe RFID polling at the same time causes crash - issue avoided since ForkPi and SpoonPi are never together on one machine
[x] delete old logs
[x] name editing must reflect with the RFID_UID and PIN
[x] lock out after entering wrong pin 5 times in a row
[x] save log
[x] Edit RFID UID
[x] Encode DB, passing of keypairs from views to templates
[x] flash messages lol
[x] salted passwords
[x] check valid pin and rfid uid
[x] check valid pin for editing
[x] PIN remove from pdf
[x] Deactivate/disable keypairs
[x] Filter logs by date, allowed/denied, uid, pin
[x] Access ForkPi over the local network using its host name
[x] Change lock-out time / attempt limit
[.] Change key used to encrypt keypairs to AES key transferred using RSA - issue avoided since acceptable security already achieved?
[x] BUG: Lockout timers are only updated after a transaction -> denied the first time you swipe after the timer expires
[.] Option for 6 digit PIN - onchange disable all existing keypairs with 4-digit PIN
	Or: Make PINs not necessarily uniform length; can be 4-10 digits
		Might require the use of an 'Enter' button for security reasons
[x] '#' enter, '*' backspace
[x] read secret key from file
[x] regenerate secret key
[.] Mass-delete disabled keypairs - no mass disabling of keypairs so no need

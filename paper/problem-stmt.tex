\section{Problem Statement}
Based on research, secure hardware-based authentication systems are still inaccessible due to their high cost \cite{InfoSecurity2012}. As a result, such systems are currently confined in the business setting. The goal of this study is to make a hardware-based authentication system that is more accessible to the public by lowering the cost of setup while maintaining a comparable level of security. In this study, three authentication factors will be considered: PIN, RFID and fingerprint. This study will compare single and two-factor authentication mechanisms involving the three factors in terms of security, usability and cost in order to determine the combination to be used. Using the same three criteria, the system will be compared to a similar product that is available commercially.

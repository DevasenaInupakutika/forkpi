Based on research, secure hardware-based authentication systems are still inaccessible due to their high cost. As a result, such systems are currently confined in the business setting. The goal of this study is to make a hardware-based authentication system that is more accessible to the public by lowering the cost of setup while maintaining or surpassing the security features of existing hardware-based authentication systems. In this study, three authentication factors will be considered: PIN, RFID and fingerprint. CD-R King's Fingerprint Time Attendance System combines all three factors, making it an ideal point of comparison for this study. This study will compare single and multi-factor authentication mechanisms involving the three factors in terms of security, usability and cost in order to determine the combination to be used.

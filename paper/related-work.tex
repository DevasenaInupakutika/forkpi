\section{Related Work}

In this section, we look at similar door security systems that are available, and compare their features with our system's. ``Capacity'' refers to the maximum number of users that can be registered at any given time. For fingerprint accuracy, ``FAR'' (false acceptance rate) refers to the rate at which unregistered fingerprints turn out a match, while ``FRR'' (false rejectionr rate) refers to the rate at which registered fingers turn out no match.

\subsection{Commercial Systems}
These systems are readily available on the market. Since they are prepackaged and mass produced, the total cost is cheaper than if you had bought the parts individually and assembled it yourself.

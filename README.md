# ForkPi 

ForkPi: A door access control system that is more accessible to the world. ForkPi stands for Fingerprint, OLED, RFID, Keypad, and Raspberry Pi.

-----------------------

### Overview

#### Motivation
Modern keyless door access control systems remain largely inaccessible to the public, due to their high cost and low transparency. Our system, ForkPi, is a cost-effective solution that is designed to be intuitive to use, and easy to customize or extend.

#### Authentication Mechanisms
It supports five different authentication mechanisms involving three factors: RFID, fingerprint and PIN. The single-door access control provided by SpoonPi easily scales to multiple doors via the accompanying web app, ForkPi, which provides secure, centralized management of multiple SpoonPis over a local network.

#### Platform
We chose the Raspberry Pi for our platform because it is open-source, accessible, and easy to set up.
